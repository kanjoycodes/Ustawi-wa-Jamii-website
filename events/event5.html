        <h2>Health and Wellness Fair</h2>
        <p> Let's come together to clean up and beautify our local parks! Join
          us for a day of community service as we pick up litter, plant
          flowers, and maintain the beauty of our green spaces for everyone to
          enjoy. Join us for a day of promoting health and wellness in our community!
          From free health screenings to fitness demonstrations, this event
          aims to educate and empower individuals to prioritize their
          well-being.</p>
