PROJECT TITLE: USTAWI WA JAMII CHARITY ORGANIZATION
The project is based on a charity organization’s website which will provide a platform for individuals to connect with the cause and purpose of the charity organization. The charity organization will be aimed towards helping orphans, the less fortunate and the aged. Individuals will be able to register and form accounts through the website and navigate through a user friendly interface which will offer information on charity initiatives, events, contributions, payments and community projects. The website will also showcase success stories that highlight the difference made by the team’s humanitarian efforts. There will be features to facilitate smooth sign-ups, easy donations and volunteering and engagement with members through reviews and feedback. To foster transparency and trust, financial reports and updates on completed and ongoing projects will be included.
